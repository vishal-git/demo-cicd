# Demo Makefile

This repository shows some examples of how to use a `Makefile` to run tests, linter, and bandit on your code.

Please note that one of the test fails; this is on purpose. Also, the linter will display some issues when you run it.

To run, clone the repository and run `make test`, `make linter`, or `make bandit` from the root folder of the repository.
